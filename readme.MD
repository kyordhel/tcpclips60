# `tcpCLIPS60`: A ROS node binding for CLIPS 6.0
This repo allows you to connect CLIPS 6.00 (version of 05/12/93) with anything supporting sockets.
This CLIPS solution is purely written in C and includes no patches, fixes, or anything.
The Server is written in C++14.

Why did I use this old version?
Don't even dare to ask. I was required to because *bananas*.

Note: one *banana* is necessary and sufficient reason to do something. Imagine many.

# QuickStart

```

2. Build the source (it may take a while)
