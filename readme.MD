# `tcpCLIPS60`: A ROS node binding for CLIPS 6.0
This repo allows you to connect CLIPS 6.00 (version of 05/12/93) with anything supporting sockets.
This CLIPS solution is purely written in C and includes no patches, fixes, or anything.
The Server is written in C++14.

Why did I use this old version? Beause: _why not!?_
CLIPS6.0 is a cool version and should suffice all our needs.
`tcpCLIPS64` is comming [SOONâ„¢](https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Soon)
